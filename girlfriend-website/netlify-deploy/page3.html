                                    <p>Happy Girlfriend's Day, My Love ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Priyanshi, my baby, my everything‚Ä¶</p>
                                    
                                    <p>These past months have been a rollercoaster for us. I know I've been wrong at times, I've overthought, and I let silly fights and insecurities get in the way of the magic we have. Some of our fights were so useless, yet they left me hurting inside because I felt like I wasn't your first priority. And in that feeling, I vented, I let my emotions take over‚Ä¶ but deep down, it was only because I love you too much.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Baby, through all of it, one thing never changed‚ÄîI never stopped loving you with every beat of my heart. Even in our worst days, I only wanted you. I only wanted us. I realize now that nothing in this world can pull us apart‚Äînot misunderstandings, not insecurities, not even ourselves.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>We are forever, baby. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                                    <p>You are the love of my life, my happiest thought, my peace, and my chaos all at once. I thank the universe every single day for giving me you‚Äîthe girl who turned my life into something magical.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>On this Girlfriend's Day, I just want you to know‚Ä¶</p>
                                    <p>I choose you, over and over, in every lifetime, in every universe.</p>
                                    <p>I love you the most, Priyanshi. Always. Forever.</p>
